# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt Chart is used to describe and document the project management life cycle enables Fire Alarm Co. staff to occasionally adhere to the rules and reach the milestone. The Gantt chart contain Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for tasks and works for every member who are involved in the project. Every members must play their roles by obeying strictly to WBS in each phases.

A part of WBS in the form of gantt chart is shown below:

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> | When the fire is not detected in testing   |In testing phase for the system|Assign team members to collect the result data until a satisfiying result is ontained and consisten.|
|Cost | The actual cost is higher than the estimated cost | When there are components price are higher than it usual price market| Financial analyst will be deployed to calculate all budgets to adapt for the system
|Time | Project is unable to follow the planned milestone  |When there are many problems are not able to solve in a short time.| Changing role between member and all members must help other depending on the size of the problem.|
