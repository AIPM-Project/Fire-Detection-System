# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
### Project Summary
IOI Corporation Berhad (IOI) is one of the leading vegetable-based oleochemical producers in the world. As the company is involved in using chemicals in the workplace to manufacture consumers’ products, it is evident that the factory is vulnerable to fire. Safety measures should always be a priority in workplaces involving the usage of chemical. 
As a first step of it, a fire detection system in the factory will be installed so that ways to curb the situation could be fasten up and necessary bodies can be notified as quick as possible. The system will detect fire in the workplace if there’s any using visual inspection. This is the very first step in developing the fire detection system in IOI factory.
