# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables:
#### Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware, our group uses the laptop which consists of intel core i7 and 16GB RAM to conduct our project.

#### Software Requirement:
As for the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in recognizing fire and PHP programming language to design the website and database connection. 

#### Intelligent System Architecture:
The proposed neural network is YOLOv4 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in antifire surveillance systems. YOLOv4 is designed with light-weight neural network architecture to account the requirements of embedded platforms.

#### Outcomes of the system
Upon, monitoring the real time surveillance video of the company the fire detection will be triggered if thereâ€™s any fire calamities occur. The YOLOv4 recognizes fire more precisely and alert the factory management as soon as fire is detected.
